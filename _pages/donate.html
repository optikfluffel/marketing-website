<h1>Donate</h1>

<p>I make the majority of my software available to the public and make sure that it is <strong>secure</strong> and <strong>add-free</strong>. One of my favorite projects that I've published is {{ site.application_name_full }}. It's available for free on the Apple App Store for iOS and MacOS.</p>

<p>Because it is free and privacy friendly, more and more people are using {{ site.application_name_full }}. Unfortunately for me, the costs are therefore slowly increasing. In addition to the time I spend developing {{ site.application_name_full }}, I spend money on an Apple Developer license, domain names and hosting for the issuer icons and Apple Push Notification proxy server.</p>

<p>If you or your company use {{ site.application_name_full }} or like what I‚Äôm doing, please consider sponsoring me so I can continue maintaining and evolving all my projects and new ones.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support! üë®‚Äçüíª</p>
